#### Description:
TripPacker is a web app with a Python and SQL backend. It's a simple packing list where items can be checked off, added, renamed and deleted, as well as assigned to different categories and luggage.
The landing page of the app is the packing list itself. In the top left it has a counter which keeps track of how many items have been checked off the list, as well as the total number of items in the list.
There are links in the main page that take you to subpages where the categories and luggage options can be edited (added, renamed, deleted). In the case of the luggage, a color can be assigned to it and, when in the main page that luggage is selected for an item, the row that that item is in will get that same color.
The item list table can be sorted by any of the headers. Click a header once and the table will be sorted in ascending order. Click it again and it will be sorted in descending order.
